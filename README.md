Note images not completely representative of what the code currently does.

TODO:
1. Create command line interface
2. Create mapping for both colors simultaneously 
3. Make mapping more consitent, and repetitive at times
4. Make mapping flow better
5. Make sure different colors don't make impossible crossovers, overlapping notes
